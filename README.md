# Stone_paper_Scissor_Game
Created an interactive Stone Paper Scissors game where users play against the computer. Implemented game  logic using JavaScript to generate random choices and determine winners.

**What is this?
    Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people. It’s often used as a decision-making tool, much like flipping a coin or drawing straws
    Built with HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT.

**How to Play:
    Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:
        ✊ Rock (a fist)
        ✋ Paper (an open hand)
        ✌️ Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)
                
**Rules:
    The winner is determined based on the following outcomes:
        Rock crushes Scissors → Rock wins
        Scissors cuts Paper → Scissors wins
        Paper covers Rock → Paper wins
        If both players choose the same shape → It’s a tie
